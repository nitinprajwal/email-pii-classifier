# üìß EmailGuard: Intelligent Classification & PII Shield API

Welcome to EmailGuard created for Akaike by Nitin Prajwal! This project provides a robust API for classifying support emails and automatically masking sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Payment Card Industry (PCI) data. It's designed to help support teams efficiently categorize inquiries while upholding strict data privacy standards.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üéØ Accurate Email Classification**: Automatically categorizes emails into **Incident, Request, Change, or Problem**.
-   **üõ°Ô∏è Advanced PII Masking**: Leverages a hybrid approach (RegEx + spaCy NER) to detect and mask a comprehensive list of PII entities without relying on LLMs. Masked entities include:
    -   Full Names
    -   Email Addresses
    -   Phone Numbers
    -   Dates of Birth (DOB)
    -   Aadhar Numbers
    -   Credit/Debit Card Numbers
    -   CVV Numbers
    -   Card Expiry Dates
-   **üöÄ FastAPI Powered**: Built with modern, high-performance FastAPI for a robust and scalable API.
-   **üì¶ Easy Deployment**: Designed for straightforward deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
-   **üîç Transparent Output**: Returns the original email, the masked email, and a detailed list of detected PII entities with their positions.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a sequential processing pipeline:

1.  **API Request**: The user sends a POST request to the `/classify` endpoint with the raw email body.
2.  **PII Masking Module (`pii_masking.py`)**:
    *   The input email is first processed by a series of **Regular Expressions** tailored to identify common PII patterns (e.g., email formats, phone numbers, card numbers).
    *   Next, **spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER)** model (`en_core_web_sm`) is used to identify contextual PII like names and dates.
    *   A custom logic resolves overlaps between entities detected by RegEx and NER, prioritizing more specific or reliable detections.
    *   The identified PII is then replaced with generic placeholders (e.g., `[NAME]`, `[EMAIL_ADDRESS]`).
3.  **Email Classification Module (`app.py` using `email_classifier.joblib`)**:
    *   The *original* (unmasked) email body is fed into a pre-trained **scikit-learn pipeline** (`email_classifier.joblib`).
    *   This pipeline likely consists of a text vectorizer (e.g., TF-IDF) followed by a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes).
    *   The model predicts one of the four predefined categories.
4.  **API Response**: The system returns a JSON object containing:
    *   The original input email.
    *   A list of all PII entities found, including their type, original value, and position in the text.
    *   The email body with all PII entities masked.
    *   The predicted email category.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies & Algorithms

-   **FastAPI**: For building the asynchronous and high-performance API.
-   **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
-   **Python**: The core programming language.
-   **PII Detection & Masking**:
    -   **Regular Expressions (RegEx)**: Custom patterns in `pii_masking.py` for precise matching of structured PII like email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, Aadhar numbers, etc.
    -   **spaCy (`en_core_web_sm`)**: Utilized for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify less structured PII such as person names (`PERSON`) and dates (`DATE`). The small English model is chosen for a balance of performance and resource usage.
    -   **Hybrid Approach**: Combines the strengths of RegEx (precision for patterns) and NER (contextual understanding) for comprehensive PII detection.
    -   **Overlap Resolution**: Custom logic to handle cases where RegEx and NER might identify overlapping entities, ensuring accurate masking.
-   **Email Classification**:
    -   **Scikit-learn**: The `email_classifier.joblib` is a pre-trained model/pipeline built using scikit-learn. This likely involves:
        -   **Text Vectorization**: Techniques like `TfidfVectorizer` or `CountVectorizer` to convert email text into numerical features.
        -   **Machine Learning Classifier**: A supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or a simple ensemble) trained on the `combined_emails_with_natural_pii.csv` dataset.
